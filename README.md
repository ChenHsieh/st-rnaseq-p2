# st-rnaseq-p2

Streamlit is particularly well-suited for creating data applications that involve file uploads, data processing, and visualization, all within a single interactive platform. If the primary goal is to make the DE analysis process more user-friendly and interactive, then Streamlit is an excellent choice.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you might set up a Streamlit app for DE analysis using PyDESeq2:

1. Set Up Environment:
Install the necessary libraries. You can do this in a virtual environment to keep things organized.

```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yaml
conda activate st-rnaseq-p2
```

2. Run the Streamlit App:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
